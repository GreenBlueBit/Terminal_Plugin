# Terminal_Plugin

This jQuery plugin allows you to have an old style CRT monitor drawn on your website with a terminal interface and any custom
functionality with just 1 line of code.

All you need to type in your javascript file is :

$.terminal(_commands,function() { return "Welcome Commander,\nPlease make use of our amenities as you see fit\n\n";},"Welcome Commander,\nPlease make use of our amenities as you see fit\n\n");

the _commands variable stores all of your custom functionality you want, which allows your computer to be a news reader, 
text adventure, chat, or anything else you'd wish.

The other two ask for a message when the computer is first loaded and the second for whenever it is pwoered on and off (yes, it has
a power button :D)

I've made two demos showing how this can be used for multiple purposes :

Their files are in here, you can also change the styling or the js however you want, just lemme know what comes out of it please.
